# Exploratory Data Analysis on a Credit Card Customer Churn Data.


# Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

In simple terms 'Customer Churn' is the fraction of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain period of time. The churn rate is an important metric companies use to know how they stand as regards customer retention. The churn rate is calculated by dividing the number of customers a company lost during a specific time period - say a month, by the number of customers at the beginning of the time frame. 

In this project, I ran exploratory data analysis on the given data set to visualize and get a sense of the general trends in product usage and customer demographics. As a follow up to this, I will be writing a predictive model to help accurately determine what data points are critical to customer churn and profer solutions on how the business can reduce churn and ultimately increase card renewals.

Hope you enjoy going through this, half as much as I enjoyed working on it.

The data set was gotten from Kaggle and the credit card company details remain undisclosed. This project was part of the final project delivery for the ZeroToPandas course by Jovian. [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](zerotopandas.com), and what you've learned from it.
